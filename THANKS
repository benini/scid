Thanks to Manuel Hoelss for programming the "Promote variation to
main line" function (which was added to Scid 2.4); to John Wiegley
for contributing the useful "pgnfix" script that cleans up PGN files
and "eco2pgn" that converts scid.eco to a PGN file; and to Mark Oakden
who wrote the useful "sc_remote" utility.

Thanks to Anjo Anjewierden for his chess player data (at www.anjo.demon.nl)
which is used to correct errors in spelling.ssp and also to automatically
generate ratings.ssp from spelling.ssp.

The piece images used in Scid are transparent GIF images generated from
some of the freeware TrueType fonts at the excellent Chess Fonts page
of the En Passant website, http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm
hosted by the Norresundby chess club.
The font authors are:
  Alpha: Eric Bentzen
  Leipzig, Merida: Armando H. Marroquin

Scid uses the free Tcl package "ezsmtp" (http://www.millibits.com/djh/tcl/)
written by D.J. Hagberg, for sending email messages using SMTP.

Finally, thanks also to Eugene Nalimov for allowing his tablebase-decoding
software to be used in Scid, and to Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler for
their free "zlib" data compression library which allows Scid to read
Gzip-compressed files.

If you think you deserve a mention here, or are mentioned but would
rather remain anonymous, just send me an email.
