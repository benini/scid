GREKO CHESS ENGINE
(c) 2002-2008 Vladimir Medvedev <vrm@bk.ru>

Version 5.9
-----------
02-Aug-2008

(fix) Fix in reporting NPS under UCI
(fix) Check extensions fixed
(chg) Make the move instantly when checkmate is found
(chg) Draw recognizer modified
(chg) Bishop and bishop pair values tuned
(chg) Small changes in search

Version 5.8.5
-------------
16-July-2008

Changes in move generator and in search:

(new) * Magic bitboards (can be turned off when MAGIC is not #defined in bitboards.h).
(new) * Legal-only move generation on all stages. At last GreKo can cheat in perft
        by not actually making moves at depth = 1 :)
(new) * Simple checks generation on first levels in qsearch.
(new) * Static exchange evaluation for captures (with batteries, without pins 
        and promotions on ply > 0).
(chg) * Pruning decisions do not rely on pv/non-pv node type, again. 
(chg) * Futility pruning turned off, again.
(chg) * Use SEE score for delta pruning in qsearch instead of VALUE[captured].
(fix) * Fixed incorrect PGN disambiguation code (introduced in 5.8, but does not affect
        playing games, just in epdtest mode) -- thanks to Dann Corbit for bug report.

Tactical abilities seem to increase:

        WACNew   WACNew   NewIQ
        1 sec.   5 sec.   10 sec.

5.7.1   271      287      243
5.8     270      286      239  (-1...-4 solved positions - due to PGN bug)
5.8.5   290      297      276

This version could be named 5.9 since it has so many changes, but I prefer to save 
numbering space for some possible improvements.

Version 5.8
-----------
10-July-2008

The main goal of this version is source code refactoring. Core datastructures
are now more "C++ style". Position and Move data encapsulated in classes.
Got rid of pointers, some #defines etc. Small optimization for all bitscan loops.

As a result the source code is 5% more compact than 5.7.1. Perft and search run
20-30% faster (at least in the initial position).

Small changes in the move generator (castlings). Search and evaluation algorithms 
are almost unchanged except for a little fix in the hashing scheme. En-passant 
and castling rights were not taken into account in the hash code, now they are.

Time management scheme changed a little, to prevent possible losses on time 
in 3+3 games. Thanks to Volker Pittlik for mentioning the bug. Multi-PV UCI mode
modified, however it is still slow and non-optimized.

(chg) Time management tuned a little
(chg) Source code reformatted
(new) MSVC8 project file added

Version 5.6
-----------
12-Apr-2008

(fix) Fix in MVV/LVA sorting

(new) Delta pruning in qsearch
(chg) Replaced get_new_depth() function with more clear code
(chg) Principal variation search (PVS) instead of plain alpha-beta

Version 3.3a
16-Jul-2006
-----------

(fix)   * Few lines in pondering code fixed. 
          Now seems to work corectly (at least, under Winboard and Arena).

Version 3.3
14-Jul-2006
-----------

1. Bugfixes.
2. Search clean-up.

(fix)   * Fixed bug in UpdateHistory which caused assertion fails from time to time (incorrect constant).
(fix)   * Now "force" command stops pondering mode. Thanks to Volker Pittlik for bug report.

(chg)   * Futility pruning thrown away from search. 
(chg)   * Out-of-check extension changed to 0.75 ply - always.
(chg)   * Nullmove parameter changed from R = (3 or 4) to const R = 3, more safe.

-----------

1. Bugfixes and code stability.

          current GreKo is a single-threaded program.
(fix)   * A really gross bug with negative depth in UpdateHistory() & RecordHash() fixed.
          Now the depth is checked to be positive in both functions.
(chg)   * Evaluation: A lot of alchemy with attacks and mobility removed from StaticEval().
          Added very basic evaluation of R, N, B mobility instead. Works faster and better.
(chg)   * Out-of-board field index constant changed from -1 to NF = 64. Now all field index 
          variables expected to be unsigned: 0...63 for fields, 64 for offboard.
(chg)   * Mailbox arrays U[64], L[64], UR[64], ... converted to single array STEPS [8][64].

(src)   * Begin to re-format source code. Indentation style: all tabs replaced by spaces.


Version 3.1
8-Jan-2006
-----------

After one-year meditations GreKo 3.x branch is again in development. 
This version goals: 1. bugfixes, 2. some changes in search 3. reviewing old code 

(fix)   * Buffer-overrun safety code in user input. Many thanks to Dann Corbit!
(fix)   * Single-reply extension (1 ply) __really__ turned on (it worked only like simple check 
          extension in 3.0).
(fix)   * Mate threat detection now works correctly (in 3.0 it was never triggered because of 
          too small search window in nullmove).

(new)   * "perft <depth> explain" command: shows perft values for all subtrees in the root.

(chg)   * Win32 binary built with MSVC 6.0 + STLPort. Works faster than MSVC's STL version.
(chg)   * Makefile for gcc (MinGW, Linux, FreeBSD) simplified. Filenames corrected.
          No more ../bin and ../obj directories.
(chg)   * Out-of-check and pawn-on-7th extensions restricted for far-behind and far-ahead
          matearial balance, respectively.
(chg)   * Window size in root diminished to +/-50 centipawns.
(chg)   * Recapture extensions diminished from ply to ply/2.
(chg)   * Default setting: ShowEvalForWhite = 0.

   * Opening book now is compiler-independent (MSVC, gcc at least).

Version 2.85
31-Dec-2004
------------

        * Fixed: incorrect resignation in some drawn endgames (incorrect pruning in QSearch).
        * New feature: GreKo now can create opening book from PGN for selected player.
        * A lot of changes in evaluation (more realistic), minor changes in search (extensions, pruning).
        * Anti-zeitnot code for blitz without increment, now GreKo loses on time more rarely.

     that gives +3...5% performance in various tests.

   * Some kind of futility pruning implemented in search.

   * "epdtest" command output modified, time and nodes calculations in test suites corrected.

   * New default settings: Learning=0, ShowEvalForWhite=0.
